# CU-Safe
Let's make Chandigarh University campus safe.

### The Problem
In the current senerio we have to show our ID cards to the gaurds on the main gate and at library. And for that we have to get in the close contact of them. This is against the guidelines for resisting the spread of corona virus.

### The Solution
CU-Safe app is able to scan your ID card and using machine vision it can verify it. After verification your ID card will be shown to the guard's app under 10 meters. This will allow us to share the ID card without getting into close contact.
